## About me

Hi! I’m Ollie.

I’m a data scientist at Ravelin, where we stop the bad guys from getting away with fraud.

As part of the data science team, I get to dive into researching and implementing new machine learning techniques, training fraud models, and tackling tricky problems with data. Naturally, a lot of the posts here might be about machine learning, statistics, or software. But you’ll also find the occasional post about other topics that spark my curiosity or things I’ve learned and want to share.

## About this blog

I’m putting this subsection partly as a reminder for myself! I started this blog for several reasons:

- **_to clarify my own reasoning_** — I find that writing about a topic helps me consolidate my understanding and identify gaps in my thinking.

- _**to create a timestamped record of my interests and learnings**_ — A way to track my growth and see how my thoughts evolve over time. I can also refer back to it if I ever need a reminder.

- **_to help me improve at expressing myself_** — I often struggle to articulate my ideas fully, and committing to this blog will help me practice and refine that skill.

- **_to share my learnings with others_** — I hope that by sharing what I’ve learned, I can help others solve similar problems or navigate challenges more effectively.

If you asked my friends, they’d probably describe me as someone who frequently gets "obsessed" with things. While some of these obsessions stick (I’ve been learning Mandarin for 7 years!), others burn brightly for a while before fading. Either way, they often last long enough to want to ramble about them a bit.

This blog is a bit of an experiment for now! All feedback is greatly appreciated.
