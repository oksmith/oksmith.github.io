In April 2025, I decided to take a 30 day break from social media and any digital media (with exceptions). 

This wasn't the most _hardcore_ digital detox, but I wanted something challenging yet manageable - long enough to learn how my brain actually works.

It took me until now (July 2025, at time of writing!) to actually write up my notes from during that time. But one benefit of that is that I have an extra couple of months of ✨data✨ to see the extent to which I've fallen back into my previous habits.

## Why did I want to give up digital media?

Firstly, a bit about me and my phone usage. 

Like so many other people, I use my phone a lot. More than I want to. But I don't think I'm a particularly severe case of it, at least not compared to some other people I know. 

For a long time, maybe 5+ years, I've been concerned about the amount of time I spend on my phone and have taken active steps to limit how distracting my phone is (for example, I've had almost all notifications turned off for ages). I value my time very highly, so the idea that we can waste so much of it without realising is quite terrifying (if you're not convinced, I find [this TED talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TMPXK9tw5U) particularly compelling). We only have so many hours on this planet, we might as well find meaningful ways to use it, and not squander it unintentionally by doomscrolling on TikTok.

<img src="/images/stayfree-text-challenge.jpg" alt="Stayfree screenshot" style="width:220px; float:right; margin: 0 0 1em 1em;">

A couple of years ago I installed [StayFree](https://stayfreeapps.com/) on my phone as an attempt to check in every now and then to examine trends in my phone usage. (_note: most phones come installed with an app like this by default, but many of them don't keep data over a long period of time._)

StayFree lets you look back up to a year, so you can track whether changes in your behaviour actually make a difference (and if those differences stick). It also lets you export the data to CSV (for data nerds like me, this is a big plus), and comes with plenty of tools to help you manage your time (my favourite: an app blocker, where if you want to keep using the app beyond your daily usage limit you must type out a long paragraph lecturing yourself about the value of time! See the image to the right).

Here are some screenshots showing my average daily phone usage during the month _before_ I started the challenge: 

<div style="display: flex; gap: 16px; justify-content: center; align-items: flex-start;">

  <img src="/images/stayfree-april-stats.jpg" alt="April Stats" style="width: 45%; max-width: 250px; border-radius: 6px;">
</div>

Around 3 hours 18 minutes per day. Not great, I'd like it to be lot lower. My mental target has always been around 1 hour 30 minutes per day.

StayFree lets you break down your usage by app, and that's where my problem becomes apparent. YouTube. And, to a lesser extent, Reddit. (Not too worried about Whatsapp).

I kind of knew this already. I don't use Instagram as much as some other people I know., and I don't use Facebook anymore. And I never _dared_ install TikTok!

For me, the addictive apps are those that spoon-feed me _information_. YouTube's algorithm knows what I want to click on better than I do, while Reddit learned my preferences from the subreddits I joined.

The real problem isn't that YouTube and Reddit are inherently bad - they're actually fantastic tools for following my interests like chess and Fantasy Premier League. The problem is that I'd stopped being intentional about using them. Instead of actively choosing to watch a specific video or read about a topic I cared about, I'd wake up and automatically open YouTube with my morning tea, living on autopilot and letting the algorithm decide what would occupy my next half hour. I'd become a passive consumer rather than an active user, and these apps had become my default response to feelings of boredom.

These apps are really, _really_ good at grabbing my attention, and being the go-to apps I open when I'm bored. It's no longer about following my hobbies at this point, it's about being _suggested_ something that distracts me.

### The Attention Economy 

A little detour into the attention economy. It's a term I'd heard in the past, but until fairly recently didn't appreciate that it literally is an economy that is powered by capturing our attention as much as possible. 

The Netflix documentary The Social Dilemma does a great job at explaining how the big tech companies make money off from our time and attention. A good example of an innovation in the attention economy is the [infinite scroll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_scrolling). 

The thing is, the richer those companies get, the more they can invest in better research and algorithms to grab our attention even more effectively. And they're pretty sophisticated; YouTube's algorithm analyses not just what you click, but how long you watch, when you pause, even the speed of your scrolling. At times it really feels like it's a war between those companies against ourselves, in the battle for our time.

A personal moment I realised I was caught in the system was when someone in The Social Dilemma said: _"Do you check your phone before you pee in the morning, or while you pee in the morning? 'Cause those are the only two options."_

Understanding the attention economy helped me realise that my struggle with digital overwhelm wasn't a personal failing - it was the intended outcome of billion-dollar systems designed to capture and monetise my attention.

## My Digital Break 

At one point in April 2025 I realised - I can't even remember the last time I felt bored. Like, actually bored. Not knowing what to do and having nothing but my thoughts to keep me company. Previous attempts at reclaiming my time back from screens didn't stick for more than a couple of months. I missed the feeling of boredom and became frustrated at how "unintentionally" I seemed to be spending my time. So eventually I decided to try a "digital break". 

I started researching to see if other people had done it before, and came across [this article](https://freedom.to/blog/digital-minimalism/) which served as a great blueprint for me. I decided that the time period needed to be long enough that I'd struggle, but not so long that I'd be tempted to give up. My digital break was from 29th April - 29th May, and that seemed about the right time for me. I also committed to writing notes to a journal so that I can record if I'd realised anything or had any reflections throughout.

So what did I actually do for my digital break. I deleted the following attention-grabbing apps from my phone:
- YouTube
- Reddit
- X
- Spotify (yes, Spotify! I realised I was also addicted to podcasts -- yet another form of content grabs my attention with ease)

There were some apps I didn't mind using but limited myself using StayFree's app blocks:
- Chess [max 30 mins]
- Strava [max 15 mins]
- FPL app [max 15 mins]
- Chrome [max 1 hour - if I want to proactively browse something I'm interested in (no content pushed on me)]
- Streaming apps, but _only in the following circumstances_
  a. to watch a film (I consider films to be a less attention-grabbing form of media), or 
  b. to watch a TV show together with my wife. If it can reasonably be considered a kind of 'quality time', then I allowed it

Basic functional apps like Whatsapp and Maps were allowed.

So what happens after the 1 month period? I set aside some time for self-reflection and I said I would write in my journal which apps to re-install, and if I do re-install them, putting together strategies and time limits on those apps each day (more on that later).

### Notes from during the digital break

Here are some (selected) notes from my journal during the digital break.

#### 2025-04-29
When I woke up this morning, it took my brain a few minutes to adjust to the fact I would have to have my cup of tea without a YouTube video to pass the time. Felt pangs of doubt. The morning is usually my most 'autopilot' time of the day.

Later, on my run today, I paid attention to the trees - what different species there were on my run that I'd never noticed before. I've always enjoyed an unplugged run, and I think that it's because it's quite boring. My mind just wanders and mulls things over, processes things I'm struggling with, and I tend to come back home feeling mentally refreshed. 

#### 2025-05-01
When I was sitting outside after going to the gym, I noticed different bird sounds. I'd love to learn more about the different bird types and see if I can tell them from their sounds (may be something to look into over the next 30 days). It's weird what you notice when just sitting there, without a phone to tempt me into checking messages.

#### 2025-05-04
Maybe it's just because I'm off work, but I do feel like I have more mental space and time to let my brain wander. Before, I'd walk home and instinctively reach for airpods and plug in the latest podcast. Now I find my brain wandering about trees, our birthdays coming up, my friends and ex-colleagues etc. 

What really is the value of that podcast I missed? Versus the value of this time spent mulling things over? Which is the better use of my time?

#### 2025-05-07
I just started my new job earlier this week. The digital break feels pretty easy as I have a lot of onboarding to keep my brain occupied.

#### 2025-05-10

I definitely feel like I'm missing out on some recent news and political events, and also on the latest AI developments. Reddit is my usual source for that stuff.

#### 2025-05-19
I've strangely found it easier than I thought not to go on YouTube. I've reflexively tried to open Reddit a few times only to find it's not there! For things like LocalLlama subreddit, Reddit could actually help me keep up to date with the AI space.

Other things have taken some digital presence - e.g. I've been on LinkedIn and BBC News more... but, they're definitely less addictive than YouTube. 

#### 2025-05-23

I'm coming up to the end of my digital break. I've started thinking about what apps I want to enable.

- I'm pretty sure I want Reddit again, but mostly because it gives me access to things like LocalLlama subreddit - a great place to get news about AI. I discovered there's a way to stop Reddit "pushing" new subreddits onto you that I need to make use of!
- On podcasts - I definitely don't feel FOMO about the episodes I missed. But…. I'd still appreciate listening to one or two special ones, especially regarding recent political events. So I'll enable Spotify, but try to use this experience as a reminder that nothing's gonna happen if I miss a few episodes.
- I don't want to re-install YouTube. Or, if I do, I want to find some way to literally stop me from clicking videos in my feed (is there an extension I can use?). _I_ want to be the one searching for videos to watch. I don't want _YouTube_ telling me what I want to watch.

#### 2025-05-28

I noticed I've been writing A LOT of notes on Google Keep the last few weeks. I'm pretty sure this is a result of (a) finishing a job, and starting a new job, which gives me a lot to reflect on (b) not having a digital media to distract me gives me more time for my brain to process things.

### Phone usage during the digital break 

So how did this actually play out? Here are the numbers:

<div style="display: flex; gap: 16px; justify-content: center; align-items: flex-start;">
  <img src="/images/stayfree-may-usage.jpg" alt="May Usage" style="width: 45%; max-width: 250px; border-radius: 6px;">
  <img src="/images/stayfree-may-stats.jpg" alt="May Stats" style="width: 45%; max-width: 250px; border-radius: 6px;">
</div>

2 hours 18 minutes per day - more than I thought it was going to be! But much better than before. I think that shows how much I use Whatsapp and stuff on a given day.

### Post detox actions and reflections 

- KEEP YOUTUBE UNINSTALLED. If I want to watch a video, I need to search it in Chrome and open up the search result proactively. That way I remain _intentional_ with my YouTube usage, which was really my main gripe in the first place (YouTube itself is fantastic tool, of course!).
- Allow Reddit. It wasn't a huge problem to begin with, seemed like a good source of news, and also I discovered you can turn off "recommended subreddits" and only receive info from ones I have joined (this was a a huge find, I don't know how I didn't realise sooner). I suspect that quite a lot of addictive apps have settings you can disable - it's probably worth a check. There's a way to do this with YouTube, but as far as I can tell, it means you also need to delete your entire search and watch history.

![](/images/reddit-settings.png)
If you navigate to Reddit's content settings, there's a toggle you can press to stop getting shown recommendations in your home feed. This was a game changer for me.
{:style="color:gray;font-style:italic;font-size:90%;text-align:center;"}

- Ironically, as soon as I re-installed Reddit I started looking for posts about digital detoxes, and came across the r/digitalminimalism subreddit. A digital forum for discussing how we should avoid digital media :)
- I _did_ actually feel more connected to nature during the break. And 2 months on, that feeling has stuck around. I have a lasting interest in trees now that means I look out for them more when wandering around London, and I started putting together a map of Burgess Park's many different species of tree.
- Maybe I should have limited my LinkedIn usage during the break. I honestly didn't think I'd use it so much. Perhaps there's another learning there, that actually I'll _always_ find some other source of distraction during certain times of the day (downtime in evenings and mornings)
- I've been much more introspective over the last 30 days. There are so many new notes I've added to Google Keep whenever I had a mental thought I wanted to write down. I read a lot about Stoicism and Buddhism over this period too, which probably played a part.

### Phone usage in the 2 months since my digital break

<div style="display: flex; gap: 16px; justify-content: center; align-items: flex-start;">
  <img src="/images/stayfree-june-usage.jpg" alt="June Usage" style="width: 45%; max-width: 250px; border-radius: 6px;">

</div>

**My phone usage has remained at around 2 hours 10 minutes!** It's difficult to know how much of this is from (a) uninstalling YouTube, (b) being busy with a new job, or (c) a genuine change in attitude towards my phone dependence. The real reason is likely a combination of all of these. My Reddit usage has gone up, and I do feel like that's currently my "go-to" app to open when I'm bored. That's something I'll work on - but I'm happy with the fact I've reclaimed 1 hour per day back from my phone. _That's an extra day per month, or, an extra two weeks per year of time._

## Conclusion 

I feel very strongly that I want to be _as intentional as possible_ with how I spend my time each day.

The attention economy, in particular addictive social media apps, are making it as hard as possible for us to be intentional with our time. They are designed to be a time sink. The more time we spend on their platforms, the more time there is to show us ads. But also, the more time we spend on their platforms, the more _data_ they have for creating targeted ads, and the better their ads work. And the more time to show us ads and the better their ads work, the more money they make.

I tried a 30-day break from addictive apps to re-assess my relationship with my phone. During that time I felt less FOMO over missed podcast episodes, more connected to nature, and spent a lot more time introspecting and writing notes to myself. After the break I decided I wanted to continue without YouTube on my phone - a change which seems to have stuck. I've reclaimed a whole hour per day back which is huge.

If you want to try out a digital break I'd highly encourage it!
