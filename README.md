### Theme
This blog uses Reverie. See the creator [here](https://github.com/amitmerchant1990).

Reverie is a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)-powered theme which is simple and opinionated. It's actually a fork of [jekyll-now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) with some additional features and personal touches which I've implemented to suit my needs for my blog.

To run the website locally, follow [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/testing-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll).
```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
